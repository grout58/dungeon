A crack in the ceiling above the middle of the north wall
allows a trickle of water to flow down to the floor. The water pools
near the base of the wall, and a rivulet runs along the wall an out
into the hall. The water smells fresh. """,

"""
A pungent, earthy odor greets you as you pull open the door and peer
into this room. Mushrooms grow in clusters of hundreds all over the
floor. Looking into the room is like looking down on a forest. Tall
tangles of fungus resemble forested hills, the barren floor looks like
a plain between the woods, and even a trickle of water and a puddle of
water that pools in a low spot bears a resemblance to a river and lake,
respectively.""",

"""
The scent of earthy decay assaults your nose upon peering through the
open door to this room. Smashed bookcases and their sundered contents
litter the floor. Paper rots in mold-spotted heaps, and shattered wood
grows white fungus.""",

"""
A rusted portcullis stands just beyond the door. Looking into the
room, you see three other exits, similarly blocked by portcullises.
Four skeletons dressed in aged clothing and rusting armor lie on the
floor in the room against the walls. They seem in poses of repose
rather than violence.""",

"""
The door creaks open, which somewhat overshadows the sound of bubbling
liquid. Before you is a room about which alchemists dream. Three tables
bend beneath a clutter of bottles of liquid and connected glass piping.
Several bookshelves stand nearby stuffed to overfilling with a jumble
of books, jars, bottles, bags, and boxes. The alchemist who set this
all up doesn't seem to be present, but a beaker of green fluid boils
over a burner on one of the tables.""",

"""
A dozen statues stand or kneel in this room, and each one lacks a head
and stands in a posture of action or defense. All are garbed for
battle. It's difficult to tell for sure without their heads, but two
appear to be dwarves, one might be an elf, six appear human, and the
rest look like they might be orcs.""",

"""
Fire crackles and pops in a small cooking fire set in the center of
the room. The smoke from a burning rat on a spit curls up through
a hole in the ceiling. Around the fire lie several fur blankets and
a bag. It looks like someone camped here until not long ago, but then
left in a hurry.""",

"""
The door to this room swings open easily on well-oiled hinges.
Beyond it you see that the chamber walls have been disguised by wood
paneling, and the stone ceiling and floor are hidden by bright marble
tiles. Several large and well-stuffed chairs are arranged about the
room along with some small reading tables."""

"""
There's a hiss as you open this door, and you smell a sour odor,
like something rotten or fermented. Inside you see a small room lined
with dusty shelves, crates, and barrels. It looks like someone once
used this place as a larder, but it has been a long time since anyone
came to retrieve food from it.""",

"""
A chill crawls up your spine and out over your skin as you look upon
this room. The carvings on the wall are magnificent, a symphony in
stonework -- but given the themes represented, it might be better
described as a requiem. Scenes of death, both violent and peaceful,
appear on every wall framed by grinning skeletons and ghoulish forms in
ragged cloaks.""",

"""
A glow escapes this room through its open doorways. The masonry
between every stone emanates an unnatural orange radiance. Glancing
quickly about the room, you note that each stone bears the carving of
someone's name.""",

"""

"""
A 30-foot-tall demonic idol dominates this room of black stone. The
potbellied statue is made of red stone, and its grinning face holds
what looks to be two large rubies in place of eyes. A fire burns
merrily in a wide brazier the idol holds in its lap.""",

"""
Several round pits lie in the floor of the room before you. Spaced
roughly equally apart, each is about 15 feet in diameter and appears
about 20 feet deep. A lattice of thick iron bars covers the top of each
pit, and each lattice has a door of iron bars that can be lifted open.
The pits smell of sweat and offal, but the room seems unoccupied.""",

"""
You poke your head through the break in the wall and look upon
a room of titanic size. It is clearly an enormous mausoleum built to
the proportions of giants. Huge niches are set into the walls within
which you can discern giant bones. Stern-looking statues of stone
giants stand 20 feet tall against the walls, and in the center of the
room lies a 15-foot-long sarcophagus.""",

"""
The scent of earthy decay assaults your nose upon peering through
the open door to this room. Smashed bookcases and their sundered
contents litter the floor. Paper rots in mold-spotted heaps, and
shattered wood grows white fungus.""",

"""
You open the door to a scene of carnage. Two male humans, a male
elf, and a female dwarf lie in drying pools of their blood. It seems
that they might once have been wearing armor, except for the elf, who
remains dressed in a blue robe. Clearly they lost some battle and
victors stripped them of their valuables.""",

"""
When looking into this chamber, you're confronted by a thousand
reflections of yourself looking back. Mirrored walls set at different
angles fill the room. A path seems to wind through the mirrors,
although you can't tell where it leads.""",

"""
As the door opens, it scrapes up frost from a floor covered in ice.
The room before you looks like an ice cave. A tunnel wends its way
through solid ice, and huge icicles and pillars of frozen water block
your vision of its farthest reaches.""",

"""
This chamber is clearly a prison. Small barred cells line the walls,
leaving a 15-foot-wide pathway for a guard to walk. Channels run down
either side of the path next to the cages, probably to allow the
prisoners' waste to flow through the grates on the other side of the
room. The cells appear empty but your vantage point doesn't allow you
to see the full extent of them all.""",

"""
A strange ceiling is the focal point of the room before you. It's
honeycombed with hundreds of holes about as wide as your head. They
seem to penetrate the ceiling to some height beyond a couple feet, but
you can't be sure from your vantage point.""",

"""
Many small desks with high-backed chairs stand in three long rows in
this room. Each desk has an inkwell, book stand, and a partially melted
candle in a rusting tin candleholder. Everything is covered with
dust.""",

"""
A dozen statues stand or kneel in this room, and each one lacks
a head and stands in a posture of action or defense. All are garbed for
battle. It's difficult to tell for sure without their heads, but two
appear to be dwarves, one might be an elf, six appear human, and the
rest look like they might be orcs.""",

"""
This chamber holds one occupant: the statue of a male figure with
elven features but the broad, muscular body of a hale human. It kneels
on the floor as though fallen to that posture. Both its arms reach
upward in supplication, and its face is a mask of grief. Two great
feathered wings droop from its back, both sculpted to look broken. The
statue is skillfully crafted.""",

"""
You enter a small room and your steps echo. Looking about, you're
uncertain why, but then a wall vanishes and reveals an enormous
chamber. The wall was an illusion and whoever cast it must be
nearby!""",

"""
Rats inside the room shriek when they hear the door open, then they
run in all directions from a putrid corpse lying in the center of the
floor. As these creatures crowd around the edges of the room, seeking
to crawl through a hole in one corner, they fight one another. The
stinking corpse in the middle of the room looks human, but the damage
both time and the rats have wrought are enough to make determining its
race by appearance an extremely difficult task at best.""",
